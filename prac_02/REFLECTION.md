Around after school (4 - 10 PM), at my home, and for about an hour.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

That I can quickly make decent and readable code, while also being able to properly follow the lecture/subject material.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Probably not much, for so long as I continue to have the presence of mind to never just "brute force" anything.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Probably how when I'm stuck at something, I tend to try and use a longer route/brute force it first before doing a smarter solution.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

My speed in coding and with what I remember and do as of now.

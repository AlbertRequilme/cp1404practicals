# The 'old' manual way to format text with string concatenation (don't do this):
print("My guitar: " + name + ", first made in " + str(year))

# A better way - using str.format() (don't do this unless you need to):
print("My guitar: {}, first made in {}".format(name, year))
print("My guitar: {0}, first made in {1}".format(name, year))
print("My {0} was first made in {1} (that's right, {1}!)".format(name, year))

# And with f-string formatting, introduced in Python 3.6 (do this)
print(f"My {name} was first made in {year} (that's right, {year}!)")

# Formatting currency (grouping with comma, 2 decimal places):
print("My {} would cost ${:,.2f}".format(name, cost))  # str.format version
print(f"My {name} would cost ${cost:,.2f}")  # preferred f-string version
